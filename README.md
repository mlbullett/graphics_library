# graphics_library

A small and efficient c++ graphics library using opengl.
Built mostly as a learning/experimental project.

Were it a class, interfaces are meant to be:

- DrawLine
- DrawRect
- DrawBox
- DrawPoly
- DrawFilledPoly
- DrawEllipse
- DrawPie

Code is annotated with implementation details, should run pretty fast.
